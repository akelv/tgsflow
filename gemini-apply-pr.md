Okay, I will analyze the adapter implementation and the requirement brief. Then I'll suggest changes to enable sandboxing, code modification, and pull request submission. First, I'll review the files.
Based on my analysis of `gemini-code.sh` and the `aibrief.md`, here are my suggested changes to allow Gemini to work in a sandbox, modify code, and submit pull requests.

### High-Level Suggestion

The current `gemini-code.sh` is a well-structured adapter for generating text and patch suggestions. To meet your new requirements, we need to evolve it into a more capable script that can interact with `git` and the file system directly.

I recommend adding new command-line flags to control these advanced features. This maintains backward compatibility while extending functionality.

### Detailed Changes

Here are the specific changes I would make to `gemini-code.sh`:

**1. Isolate Work with a Working Directory**

To ensure the script operates in a specific, predictable location, I suggest adding a `--workdir` option.

*   **New Argument:** `--workdir <path>`
*   **Implementation:** Add this to the argument parsing loop and execute a `cd "$WORKDIR"` at the beginning of the script. This makes all file operations relative to the specified directory.

```bash
# --- At the top of the script ---
WORKDIR="."

# --- In the argument parsing loop ---
    --workdir) WORKDIR=${2:-}; shift 2 ;;

# --- After argument parsing ---
if [ "$WORKDIR" != "." ]; then
  cd "$WORKDIR" || die "Could not change to working directory: $WORKDIR"
fi
```

**2. Enable Sandboxed Execution**

For safety and reproducibility, you can run the Gemini command inside a Docker container.

*   **New Argument:** `--sandbox-image <docker_image_name>`
*   **Implementation:** If this flag is provided, the script would wrap the `gemini` command in a `docker run` call. The working directory would be mounted into the container.

```bash
# --- In the command execution section ---
RUN=("$GEMINI_CMD" "${ARGS[@]}")

if [ -n "$SANDBOX_IMAGE" ]; then
  # Re-build the RUN command for docker execution
  # Mount current directory ($PWD) as /work in the container
  RUN=( "docker" "run" "--rm" "-i" "-v" "$PWD:/work" "-w" "/work" "$SANDBOX_IMAGE" "${RUN[@]}" )
fi

if [ -n "$TIMEOUT_SEC" ] && command -v timeout >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  # ... (timeout logic remains similar)
fi
```

**3. Apply Code Changes Directly**

Instead of just suggesting a patch, the script could apply it directly.

*   **New Argument:** `--apply-patch`
*   **Implementation:** When this flag is present and the output is a patch, use `git apply` to apply the changes to the working tree.

```bash
# --- In the output handling section ---
if is_patch "$OUTPUT"; then
  if [ "$APPLY_PATCH" = "true" ]; then
    printf "%s" "$OUTPUT" | git apply -v || die "Failed to apply patch."
    log "Patch applied successfully."
    exit 0
  else
    # ... (existing logic to save the patch file)
  fi
fi
```

**4. Automate the Pull Request Workflow**

This is the most significant addition and combines the previous steps into a full workflow.

*   **New Arguments:**
    *   `--create-pr`: A flag to enable this workflow.
    *   `--new-branch <branch_name>`: The name for the new branch.
    *   `--commit-message <message>`: The commit message.
*   **Implementation:** This requires a sequence of `git` commands and assumes that a tool like the GitHub CLI (`gh`) is available for PR creation.

```bash
# --- Add this as a new workflow, probably best checked at the start ---
if [ "$CREATE_PR" = "true" ]; then
  [ -n "$NEW_BRANCH" ] || die "--new-branch is required with --create-pr"
  [ -n "$COMMIT_MESSAGE" ] || die "--commit-message is required with --create-pr"

  # 1. Create and switch to a new branch
  git checkout -b "$NEW_BRANCH" || die "Could not create branch $NEW_BRANCH"

  # 2. Run the Gemini command to get the output (patch)
  #    (The main part of the script runs here)
  OUTPUT="$(printf "%s" "$FINAL_PROMPT" | "${RUN[@]}")"
  STATUS=$?
  [ $STATUS -eq 0 ] || die "Gemini command failed with exit code $STATUS"

  # 3. Apply the patch
  if is_patch "$OUTPUT"; then
    printf "%s" "$OUTPUT" | git apply -v || die "Failed to apply patch."
  else
    echo "Output is not a patch. Cannot create PR." >&2
    git checkout - # Switch back to original branch
    exit 1
  fi

  # 4. Stage, commit, push, and create PR
  git add .
  git commit -m "$COMMIT_MESSAGE"
  git push origin "$NEW_BRANCH"
  gh pr create --fill --body "PR created by tgsflow gemini-code.sh adapter." || die "Failed to create PR. Is 'gh' installed and configured?"

  log "Successfully created PR for branch $NEW_BRANCH"
  exit 0
fi
```

These changes would transform your `gemini-code.sh` adapter into a powerful tool for automated code modification and submission, while the sandboxing feature adds a layer of safety.
