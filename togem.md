Look at my current gemini adapter implementation at tgs/adapters/gemini-code.sh and the requirement brief for the implementation at tgs/thoughts/ff006d7-gemini-ai-brain/aibrief.md files. 
Suggest the change you would make to allow gemini to work on a sandbox and change code, submit PR to a new branch in an given directory
