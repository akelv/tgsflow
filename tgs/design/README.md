# Design Artifacts Overview

This directory contains the minimal set of design artifacts for the TGS workflow.  
Each file maps to a stage of the needs → requirements → design → validation loop.

## Contents
- `00_context.md` — Personas, scope, scenarios, constraints
- `10_needs.md` — Stakeholder needs (EARS style)
- `20_requirements.md` — System requirements (functional + non-functional)
- `30_architecture.md` — System structure (C4-level diagrams/links)
- `40_vnv.md` — Verification & validation plan
- `50_decisions.md` — Architecture decisions & change log

## How to Use
1. Start with **context.md** → define personas, scope, and constraints.
2. Capture **needs.md** → express stakeholder needs clearly.
3. Translate to **requirements.md** → write “shall” statements.
4. Map design in **architecture.md** → overview of components.
5. Plan tests in **vnv.md** → link each requirement to verification.
6. Track trade-offs in **decisions.md** → one ADR per decision.
