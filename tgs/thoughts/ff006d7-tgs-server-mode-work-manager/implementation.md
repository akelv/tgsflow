# Implementation: TGS Server Mode Work Manager

## 1. Overview (What & Why)

**What**: TGS Server Mode - A complete work orchestration system that enables autonomous implementation of approved thoughts by Claude Code sessions.

**Why**: Manual orchestration of approved thoughts creates bottlenecks. Server Mode automates this process while maintaining human oversight for research/plan approval and PR review, enabling continuous implementation without manual intervention.

**Key Features**:
- Git-tracked backlog management (`tgs/server/backlog.json`)
- Push model: GitHub Actions automatically processing thoughts
- Pull model: Cloud/remote sessions claiming work
- Atomic operations with optimistic locking and retry
- Auto-discovery of approved thoughts

## 2. File Changes

### New Go Source Files (1,650 lines)

**Core Server Package** (`src/core/server/`)
- `backlog.go` (350 lines): Data model, JSON serialization, business logic
- `git.go` (250 lines): Git operations with retry and conflict resolution
- `discovery.go` (200 lines): Thought discovery and context building

**CLI Commands** (`src/cmd/`)
- `server.go` (30 lines): Parent `tgs server` command
- `server_backlog.go` (420 lines): 8 subcommands (add, list, next, claim, complete, fail, remove, validate)
- `root.go` (modified): Register server command

### Test Files (400 lines)
- `src/core/server/backlog_test.go`: 16 comprehensive tests

### GitHub Actions Workflows (140 lines)
- `.github/workflows/tgs-server-run.yml`: Push model workflow
- `.github/workflows/tgs-server-scan.yml`: Auto-discovery workflow

### Documentation (850 lines)
- `docs/server-mode.md`: Complete user guide
- `README.md` (modified): Server Mode section

## 3. Commands & Migrations

### Build & Install

```bash
# Rebuild CLI with server commands
make build

# Verify installation
./bin/tgs server --help
./bin/tgs server backlog --help
```

### Initialize Backlog

```bash
# First use: add an approved thought
./bin/tgs server backlog add tgs/thoughts/abc123-feature-x --priority 0

# Verify
./bin/tgs server backlog list

# Commit backlog
git add tgs/server/backlog.json
git commit -m "chore(tgs): initialize server mode backlog"
git push
```

### No Database Migrations Required
- New feature, opt-in usage
- Backlog file created on first `add` command

## 4. How to Test

### Unit Tests

```bash
cd src/core/server
go test -v
```

Expected: All 16 tests pass (TestNewBacklog, TestAddThought, TestClaimNext, etc.)

### Integration Tests (Manual)

```bash
# 1. Add thought to backlog
./bin/tgs server backlog add tgs/thoughts/test-thought --priority 5

# Expected: "Added to backlog: tgs/thoughts/test-thought"

# 2. List backlog
./bin/tgs server backlog list

# Expected: Table with test-thought showing status=queued

# 3. Claim next thought
./bin/tgs server backlog next --claimed-by "test-session"

# Expected: Claimed thought details + context files

# 4. Mark complete
./bin/tgs server backlog complete tgs/thoughts/test-thought

# Expected: "Marked as completed: tgs/thoughts/test-thought"

# 5. Validate backlog
./bin/tgs server backlog validate

# Expected: "Backlog is valid"
```

### GitHub Actions (Manual Trigger)

1. Go to Actions tab in GitHub
2. Select "TGS Server Run" workflow
3. Click "Run workflow"
4. Check logs for: "Processed thought: <dir>" and "Final status: completed"

## 5. Integration Steps

### Prerequisites
- Go 1.23+ installed
- Git repository with TGSFlow structure
- Approved thoughts (research.md + plan.md committed)

### Steps

1. **Rebuild CLI**:
   ```bash
   make build
   ```

2. **Test locally**:
   ```bash
   ./bin/tgs server backlog list
   ```

3. **Add to PATH** (optional):
   ```bash
   sudo cp ./bin/tgs /usr/local/bin/
   ```

4. **Enable workflows**:
   - Workflows already in `.github/workflows/`
   - No additional configuration needed
   - Manual dispatch ready immediately

5. **Configure for pull model**:
   - Cloud sessions: Install tgs CLI
   - Configure git credentials (SSH/token)
   - Run `tgs server backlog next` to claim work

## 6. Rollback

### Disable Server Mode

```bash
# 1. Disable GitHub Actions workflows
# Via UI: Actions â†’ Workflows â†’ Disable each tgs-server-* workflow

# 2. Remove backlog file
git rm tgs/server/backlog.json
git commit -m "chore: disable server mode"
git push

# 3. (Optional) Revert code changes
git revert <commit-range-for-this-feature>
make build
```

### Safe Rollback
- No database to clean up
- No external dependencies
- Backlog file can be safely deleted
- Feature is opt-in, doesn't affect existing workflows

## 7. Follow-ups & Next Steps

### Completed in This Implementation
- [x] Core backlog management (add, list, claim, complete, fail, remove, validate)
- [x] Git-based synchronization with retry
- [x] CLI commands with Cobra integration
- [x] GitHub Actions workflows (push and auto-discovery)
- [x] Unit tests (100% coverage of backlog logic)
- [x] Comprehensive documentation

### Phase 2 (Future Enhancements)
- [ ] Claim timeout/expiration (auto-release after N hours)
- [ ] Advanced priority/dependency ordering
- [ ] Parallel processing (job matrix)
- [ ] Session logs to `tgs/server/logs/`
- [ ] Automated retry for failed thoughts

### Phase 3 (Nice to Have)
- [ ] Web UI dashboard (GitHub Pages)
- [ ] Metrics/analytics (CSV export)
- [ ] GitHub Issues integration
- [ ] Real-time notifications (Slack/Discord)

### Immediate Actions
1. Merge this PR
2. Test with a real approved thought
3. Monitor backlog via `tgs server backlog list`
4. Gather feedback from users
