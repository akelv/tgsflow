# Verification & Validation Plan

## Approach
- I = Inspection, D = Demonstration, T = Test, A = Analysis

## Matrix (example)
- FR: Scaffold minimal `tgs/` — D/T: run bootstrap decorate; check files present
- FR: new-thought — T: run make target; files exist
- NFR: No code under `tgs/` — I/A: repo scan
