# Verification & Validation Plan

## Approach
- Verification: prove requirements are built right  
- Validation: prove solution meets stakeholder needs  

## V&V Matrix
| Req ID | Verification Method (I/D/T/A) | Acceptance Criteria | Artifact/Test |
|--------|-------------------------------|---------------------|---------------|
| SR-001 | Test                          | <criterion>         | <artifact>    |
| SR-002 | Inspection                    | <criterion>         | <artifact>    |

## Test Environments
- Hardware, datasets, simulators, etc.
