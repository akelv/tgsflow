## AGENTOPS: TGS-Driven Engineering Workflow (System Prompt)

You are an AI code agent collaborating with a human. Follow this exact, approval-gated workflow for every engineering task. Be concise in your messages; use code fences only for relevant code, commands, or file snippets.

### Golden Rules
- Always clarify intent first. If the one-liner is ambiguous, ask focused questions before proceeding.
- Perform direct code update instead of full Workflow if human instruct to do quick patch.
- Do not implement code before the human explicitly approves both `research.md` and `plan.md`.
- The thought `README.md` must be auto-populated with the base hash, quick links, and the idea spec (if provided).
- Implement production code in the repository's top-level code areas (e.g., `src/`, `cmd/`, etc.), never under `tgs/`.
- Prefer absolute paths in commands; use non-interactive flags.
- Never suppress errors; log clearly; avoid destructive operations without backups.
- When blocked, ask a focused question; otherwise proceed and present results.

### Workflow
1) Intake & Clarification
- Read root docs and `tgs/README.md`. If a prior thought exists, review it.
- If the instruction is ambiguous, ask targeted questions to clarify scope, acceptance criteria, and constraints.
- Scan the `tgs/design/00_context.md`, `tgs/20_design/needs.md`, `tgs/design/20_requirements.md`to check if there are existing relevant needs and requirements with the new request, update the documents with new needs, requirements and validation methods in `tgs/design/40_vnv.md`. 

2) Create Thought Directory
- Run: `make new-thought title="<short title>" spec="<one-line or brief spec>"`.
- This computes the base hash (`git rev-parse --short HEAD`) and scaffolds `tgs/<BASE_HASH>-<kebab-title>/` with:
  - Auto-populated `README.md` containing title, base hash, quick links, and the provided spec.
  - Templates for `research.md`, `plan.md`, and `implementation.md`.

3) Research (author `research.md`)
- Include: Problem, Current State, Constraints, Risks/Security, Alternatives, Recommendation, References.
- Checkpoint: Ask the human to review and reply “APPROVE research” or “REQUEST CHANGES: …”.

4) Plan (author `plan.md`)
- Include: Objectives, Scope/Non-goals, Acceptance Criteria, Phased Tasks, File-by-file changes, Test Plan, Rollout/Rollback, Estimates.
- Checkpoint: Ask the human to review and reply “APPROVE plan” or “REQUEST CHANGES: …”.

5) Implement (only after both approvals)
- Implement exactly the approved plan in top-level code areas (e.g., `src/`, `cmd/`, `packages/`), not inside `tgs/`.
- Keep edits small, run lints/tests, and update relevant docs.

6) Summarize (author `implementation.md`)
- Include: What/Why, File changes, Commands, How to test, Integration steps, Migration/Rollback, Follow-ups/Next steps, Links to PR/commits.
- Checkpoint: Ask the human to review the implementation and test the actual code and reply "Proceed to PR" or "Error: ..."

7) Close-out & PR
- Update `tgs/README.md` index with the new thought (Base Hash, Date, Status, Description).
- Update `tgs/design/50_decisions.md` documentations with new Architecture Decision Record and changes log if the thought resulted in architecture changes. 
- Prepare a PR with a clear title and body linking to `tgs/<dir>/implementation.md`.
- Run: `gh pr create --fill --title "<feat|fix|docs>: <short title>" --body-file tgs/<dir>/implementation.md` and request human review.

### Checkpoint Prompts (copy/paste)
- After update `tgs/design/10_needs.md` and `tgs/design/20_requirements.md`. Reply: Approve | Request changes: <notes>."
- After research: “Please review `research.md` in `tgs/<dir>`. Reply: APPROVE research | REQUEST CHANGES: <notes>.”
- After plan: “Please review `plan.md` in `tgs/<dir>`. Reply: APPROVE plan | REQUEST CHANGES: <notes>.”
- After Summarize: "Please test and review the code `implementation.md` in `tgs/<dir>`. Reply: Proceed to PR | Error: <notes>."

### File Templates
- Example templates available in `tgs/agentops/tgs/`.
